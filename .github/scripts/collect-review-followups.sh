# Turns the review findings a merged PR left behind into one tracked issue, so that
# "advisory" means queued rather than discarded.
#
# The blocking/advisory split only works if the advisory half survives the merge. The
# 30-day record says which mechanism survives and which does not, unambiguously:
#
#   survived — every one became a tracked artifact: tbc-doc-pipeline#98 -> issue #101 and
#              PR #104; #107's four open findings -> PR #110; fsmc#136 -> #137;
#              fivetran-dbt#202 -> #203; tbc-agents#283 -> #284
#   lost     — replied-to, or posted late, then died with the PR: tbc-platform#441 (five
#              real design-security findings, five minutes after merge, never addressed),
#              tbc-mcp-server#296 (cache poisoning, 64 seconds late), tbc-doc-pipeline#108
#              (a runtime banner contradicting the PR's own fix, never fixed)
#
# A finding survives if and only if it becomes an issue. A resolved thread is a deleted
# finding. So this does not ask the author to remember at merge time — which is exactly
# when the PR is green and they are done.
#
# What it collects: **every unresolved thread an automated reviewer (Copilot or Claude) raised
# on the merged PR**, whatever its tier and whenever it was posted. A thread a HUMAN started is
# deliberately not collected — test-collect-review-followups.sh pins that. Tier and lateness are annotations in the issue, never admission
# criteria — see the long note above the selection for the four separate times a predicate
# silently ate a finding. A thread posted after mergedAt had no chance to gate anything, and a
# thread tagged BLOCKING that is still open means the review gate was missed; both are called
# out at the top of the issue rather than filtered.
#
# Idempotent: one issue per PR, looked up by title and updated rather than duplicated.
# Safe to re-run, and safe for the daily sweep to revisit the same PR.
#
# Usage (env-driven; the workflow passes GitHub values through env:, never by
# interpolating them into the command line — see conventions/make-hub.md):
#   REPO=owner/name PR_NUMBER=123 ./collect-review-followups.sh

# Carry EVERY unresolved bot thread. Nothing about the decision to keep a finding is
# allowed to depend on parsing its text.
#
# That rule is written in blood. This script dropped findings on the floor three times, each
# time because some predicate had to match before the finding counted:
#   1. surfaced findings posted as issue comments, which this script does not read at all
#   2. a transient API failure demoting a thread back to that same unread comment
#   3. an author-login test that rejected the `github-actions[bot]` threads we post ourselves
#   4. `test("ADVISORY:")` missing a finding tagged `ADVISORY (dry-and-reuse.md):` — a
#      parenthetical between the word and the colon, and the finding vanished
#
# Every one was the same defect wearing a different hat: a finding reaching a state where
# nothing carries it. Tier and lateness are still computed, but only to ANNOTATE the issue —
# never to decide admission. A regex cannot lose a finding it does not gate.
#
# Admission is therefore: unresolved, and raised by an automated reviewer (the author test below:
# Copilot or Claude — a human's thread is out of scope). The marker clause covers the
# threads surface-suppressed-findings.sh posts under the workflow's GITHUB_TOKEN, which no
